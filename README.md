# Activity-context-recognition-system

The Activity context recognition system is a system that calculates the raw data with various mathematical functions to make different and meaningful results. This system can calculate the 'Mean', 'Median', 'Standard Deviation', 'Variance', 'Root Mean Square', 'Sum of Squares', 'Covariance', and 'Zero Crossing' for the given set of raw data. Firstly, the whole raw data set will be converted into one dictionary. Then the user can access the raw data which are as the dictionary items, by providing the axis names. Each feature accepts a dictionary parameter which consists of the raw data. Then the dictionary of data will be manipulated according to the mathematical functions. The raw data file can be input by entering the file path with the file name. The system could calculate the above-mentioned various features as a whole or as individual features. The results of the data will be output as a CSV file into the current working directory.
